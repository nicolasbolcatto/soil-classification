# soil-classification

# Project description

This is a simple routine software that is able to take soil data from field and laboratory testing, process it and
classify soils according to USCS (Universal Soil Classification System). It also plots results in terms of
natural water content, liquid and plastic limit, and grain size distribution as a function of depth. A .csv file is
finally obtained with processed results.

At this point, code is written in a functional programming function. The goal is to upgrade behaviour in order to
use OOP and allow for reutilisation of the logic in further stages of development.

# Languages, platforms and technologies

The following languages, platforms and technologies are included in the project:

- Python
- pandas and matplotlib libraries
- File input/output (.csv)

# Functionality

So far, functionality is quite basic but stills adds value as multiple calculations are performed rapidly. In the future,
upgrades should be made to separate code in different files and allow for OOP. Luckily, this code will be a part of a full
project soon.
